            <h3>Nutrient pollution</h3>
            <p>Nutrient pollution is the process where too many nutrients, mainly nitrogen and phosphorus, are added to bodies of water and can act like fertilizer, causing excessive growth of algae. Nutrients can run off of land in urban areas where lawn and garden fertilizers are used.</p>

            <img src="images/oil pollution.jpg"alt="">
            <h3>Oil Pollution</h3>
            <p> Oil pollution occurs when the liquid form of petroleum leaks into an ecosystem due to anthropogenic (human) causes. Oil pollution most commonly occurs in the form of oil spills, which result in the release of a large amount of oil into marine and coastal waterways, with devastating consequences.</p>

            <h3>Industrial Pollution</h3>
            <p>Industrial waste is the waste produced by industrial activity which includes any material that is rendered useless during a manufacturing process such as that of factories, mills, and mining operations. Types of industrial waste include scrap metal, oil, chemicals and so on.</p>

            <img src="images/soil erosion.jpg"alt="">
            <h3>Controlling soil erosion</h3>
            <p>Mulching. Planting a cover crop such as winter rye in vegetable gardens. Includes annual grasses, small grains, legumes and other types of vegetation planted to provide a temporary vegetative cover. Cover crops are often tilled under serving also as a “green manure” crop.</p>

            <img src="images/plastic waste.jpg" alt="">
            <h3>Reducing plastic waste</h3>
            <p>Plastic waste is a huge issue. More than 8 tonnes of plastic enters our ocean every year, plus the plastic is to outweigh the number of fish by 2050, these facts are shocking! Plastic waste also decays water supplies. This is why it is extremely important to reduce plastic waste and improve sustainability both locally and globally. </p>

            <img src="images/septic tank.jpg" alt="">
            <h3>Septic tanks</h3>
            <p>Septic tanks are a great way to efficiently treat sewage; separating solids from liquid. Septic tanks degrade solids and allow liquid to flow into drainage systems via biological processes. Using septic tanks reduces water pollution by removing pollutants already present in water. </p>

            <img src="images/Stormwater Management.jpg" alt="">
            <h3>Stormwater management</h3>
            <p>Another way we can combat water pollution is to manage stormwater where possible. Stormwater flows along the road and other surfaces, which can collect viruses, bacteria, and other harmful pollutants, which then make their way into drains, rivers, and eventually the ocean. </p>
